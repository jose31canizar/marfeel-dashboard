## Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### ``

### `npm start && cd ../server && yd`

This launches the project in dev mode for other developers to change the code and immediately see changes. This runs both the client and the fake server.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `CI=true npm test`

Runs all tests once without watching for live changes.

### `npm run build`

This builds the project for deployment.
